Simple ER Diagram and SQL schema for Hospital management system  project
# Hospital Management System ER Diagram

This project includes an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and SQL schema for a simple hospital management system built using PostgreSQL.

## What Iâ€™ve Done:
- Designed tables: Doctors, Patients, Appointments, Medications, and Prescriptions
- Created relationships between them using Foreign key (its called refrences as well) to connect them
- Generated a visual ER diagram using pgAdmine ER Tool

## How to Use
- Run the SQL script in pgAdmin or PostgreSQL
- View the ER diagram  as an image

A patient can book appointment to the doctor according to their need and hospital managemnet sysytem can give medication and prescription to the patient.
