Simple ER Diagram and SQL schema for Hospital management system  project
# Hospital Management System ER Diagram

This project includes an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and SQL schema for a simple hospital management system built using PostgreSQL.

## What Iâ€™ve Done:
- Designed tables: Doctors, Patients, Appointments, Medications, and Prescriptions
- Created relationships between them
- Written a SQL script to create the schema
- Generated a visual ER diagram

## How to Use
- Run the SQL script in pgAdmin or PostgreSQL
- View the ER diagram  as an image
